    \\boo: sessions that haunt your terminal
    \\
    \\A terminal multiplexer in the spirit of GNU screen, built on
    \\libghostty. Sessions keep running when you disconnect; reattach
    \\and the screen, scrollback, and title come back exactly as a
    \\human would see them.
    \\
    \\usage:
    \\  boo [command] [arguments]
    \\
    \\  With no arguments, boo attaches the most recently active
    \\  session, or starts a new one if none exist.
    \\
    \\commands:
    \\  new [name] [-d] [-- cmd...]  start a session (attach unless -d)
    \\  attach, at [name]            attach a session (steals politely)
    \\  ls [--json]                  list sessions
    \\  send [-s name] [text]        type into a session
    \\  peek [name]                  print the session's screen
    \\  wait [name]                  block until output matches or settles
    \\  kill [name | --all]          end a session
    \\  exorcise                     end every session
    \\  version                      print the version
    \\  help [command | topic]       this overview, or detailed help
    \\
    \\topics:
    \\  keys        the C-a key bindings inside a session
    \\  automation  driving boo from scripts and AI agents
    \\
    \\Run 'boo help <command>' for flags and examples, or
    \\'boo help --all' to print every page at once.
    \\
    \\session selection:
    \\  Commands taking [name] accept a unique prefix of the session
    \\  name. With no name, the only session is used, or the most
    \\  recently active one for read-only commands; commands that
    \\  destroy state never guess between multiple sessions.
    \\
    \\environment:
    \\  BOO_DIR  socket directory
    \\           (default: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/boo, else /tmp/boo-<uid>)
    \\  BOO_LOG  append daemon logs to this file (debugging)
    \\

    \\  0 success    1 error    2 usage error
    \\  3 no such session       4 wait timed out
